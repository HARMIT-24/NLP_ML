Study on Optimising Feature Selection in Hate Speech using Evolutionary Algorithms
This is a work on NLP, for hate speech detection and cyberbullying, using simple machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forrest Classifier, using feature selection techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec and Bag Of Words techniques, which are tried to optimised using Swarm Based and Evolutionary Algorithms like PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) and Genetic Algorithm. The same has been submitted for publication in  IEMIS 2022
